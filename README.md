Pokemon CAPTCHA
===============

[Pokemon](http://www.pokemon.com/us/) seem like they'd make a great CAPTCHA,
don't they? Well, I thought they would, and when I got bored one day, I made one.

## Copyright

I don't own the copyright to Pokemon, [Nintendo](http://nintendo.com/) does.
My using them in this project is purely for the sake of humor.

## License

There isn't one, use this however you see fit.
